ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan - Economics Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. My main research interest is to use large-scale obeservational data to understand fundamental questions in development economics and political economy. I code in Python, R, Stata, and Matlab. I use a diverse set of methods for causal inference: Traditional regression methods and modern econometric methods (Differences-in-Differences, Instrumental Variables, Regression Discontinuity Designs) as well as structural estimation (which relies a lot on numerical optimization). Some of my projects work with randomized controlled trials (RCTs). And I solve many data problems using data science tools, such as natural language processing in TenserFlow, entity resolution algorithms, and web-scraping.

I'm passionate about outdoor activities, scuba diving, and Indian cuisine and culture!
